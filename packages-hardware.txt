# Hardware-Specific Packages
# ===========================
# These packages are SYSTEM-SPECIFIC and should be installed based on YOUR hardware.
# DO NOT install all of these - only install what matches your system!

# === CPU Microcode ===
# Install ONLY the one matching your CPU:
# For AMD CPUs:
#amd-ucode
# For Intel CPUs:
#intel-ucode

# === GPU Drivers ===
# Install based on your GPU vendor. You may have multiple GPUs (integrated + discrete).

# --- NVIDIA GPU Drivers ---
# For systems with NVIDIA GPUs (GeForce, RTX, Quadro, etc.)
# Uncomment these lines if you have NVIDIA hardware:
#nvidia-utils
#lib32-nvidia-utils
#opencl-nvidia
#lib32-opencl-nvidia
#libva-nvidia-driver
#nvidia-settings
#linux-cachyos-nvidia-open
#linux-cachyos-lts-nvidia-open

# --- AMD GPU Drivers ---
# For systems with AMD GPUs (Radeon, RX, etc.)
# Uncomment these lines if you have AMD hardware:
#vulkan-radeon
#lib32-vulkan-radeon
#xf86-video-amdgpu

# --- Intel GPU Drivers ---
# For systems with Intel integrated graphics
# Uncomment these lines if you have Intel hardware:
#vulkan-intel
#lib32-vulkan-intel
#intel-media-driver
#libva-intel-driver

# === How to Use This File ===
# 1. Determine your hardware:
#    CPU: cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep vendor
#    GPU: lspci | grep -E "VGA|3D"
#
# 2. Uncomment (remove the #) from the lines matching YOUR hardware
#
# 3. Run the install script to install your hardware-specific packages
#
# 4. For hybrid graphics (e.g., Intel iGPU + NVIDIA dGPU):
#    - Install drivers for BOTH GPUs
#    - Consider installing 'envycontrol' or 'optimus-manager' from AUR

# === Installation ===
# After uncommenting your drivers, run:
#   ./install.sh
# Or manually install with:
#   paru -S --needed $(grep -v '^#' packages-hardware.txt | grep -v '^$')
